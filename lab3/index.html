				<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure</h1>
				<p>Not too much of a challenge, as I had already begun messing around with my website, 
			   adding some links to my music stuff for fun. I also figured out a way to get images
			   to be in a nice row side by side, so that helped the process of adding another picture.
